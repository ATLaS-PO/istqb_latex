# Introduction

## Purpose of this Syllabus
This syllabus outlines the scope of the Agile Test Leadership at Scale certification.

Together with the ATLaS body of knowledge the syllabus forms the basis for the International Software Testing Qualification for AgileTestLeadership at Scaleat theAdvancedLevel. The ISTQB® provides this syllabus as follows:

  To member boards, to translate into their local language and to accredit training providers. Member boards may adapt the syllabus to their particular language needs and modify the references to adapt to their local publications.
  To certification bodies, to derive examination questions in their local language adapted to the learning objectives for this syllabus.
  To training providers, to produce courseware and determine appropriate teaching methods.
  To certification candidates, to prepare for the certification exam (either as part of a training course or independently).
  To the international software and systems engineering community, to advance the profession of software and systems testing, and as a basis for books and articles.

## The Agile Test Leadership at Scale Certification

The ISTQB® Agile Test Leadership at Scale (CTAL-ATLaS) certification focuses on how to organize and improve quality and testing across multiple teams in an agile organization. It also covers how to approach quality and testing at a strategic level in order to achieve higher business agility in an organization.

The Advanced Level Agile Test Leadership at Scale (ATLaS) qualification is aimed at people who work in organizations that are pursuing agility at scale or business agility and already have a basic understanding of Agile software development and agile testing.

This includes people in roles such as test manager, head of testing, quality coach, agile test leader, agile test team leader, test analyst, technical test analyst, test automation engineer, quality engineer, quality assurance, member of an agile team, member of a leadership team leading multiple agile teams, IT director, project manager, release train engineer, scrum master, product owner, and management consultant.

## Career Path for Testers
The ISTQB® scheme provides support for testing professionals at all stages of their careers offering both breadth and depth of knowledge.

The Advanced Level Agile Test Leadership at Scale builds on the qualifications in Foundation Level Certified Tester and Foundation Level Agile Tester. Certified Tester provides the basic knowledge and competencies in software testing. Agile Tester expands on Certified Tester and explains how testing is performed in an agile team.

As Agile Test Leadership at Scale focuses on the organizational level, it supplements the Advanced Level Agile Technical Tester which focuses on technical practices. It also supplements Advanced Level Test Management, which focuses on projects and not on organizational aspects. In addition, Advanced Level Test Management covers traditional approaches and hybrid approaches.

Individuals who achieve the ISTQB® Agile Test Leadership at Scale certification may also be interested in the other Core Advanced Level certifications Test Management and Test Analyst, and the Specialist certifications especially Test Automation Engineer, AI Testing and Model-Based Tester.

## Business Context

Organizations strive to improve their business agility to provide valuable products and services in a changing world. A key way to improve business agility is to transform the culture and mindset by using different principles, frameworks, disciplines, and methodologies such as agile, lean, and DevOps, which we here cover with the term "business agility". One common principle in these frameworks and disciplines is the focus on delivering value with the quality that customers demand, i.e., customer- focused. Therefore, the term value-driven is used to describe organizations that strive to achieve business agility regardless of their various ways of working.

Agile software development started as a way to improve how software was delivered iteratively. It focused on a small delivery team that could release software in shorter iterations than the traditional software development lifecycles. As the popularity of the Agile software development grew, it became apparent that at times there was a need for several delivery teams to collaborate in order to develop larger and more complex systems (also called a team of agile teams). Therefore, new frameworks were created in order to scale agile from individual agile delivery teams to multiple delivery teams contributing to the value of the solution. Delivery teams often consist of people from different organizations that work together to provide the overall solution. This move from focusing on individual delivery teams to multiple teams is called "agile at scale" or "scaled agile." This also requires that testing approaches are scaled.

Scaling agile is not necessarily the same as business agility, which includes the entire enterprise, but in order to achieve business agility an organization could benefit from adopting agile at scale.

With business agility there is an even greater need for accelerated quality. This is not achievable if all responsibility for quality remains in the individual teams or specific roles such as testers. Therefore, test management moves to quality management and organizations need to adopt quality assistance across the organization as well as within delivery teams. This changes the role of quality assurance and test professionals to be closer to agile test leadership and to fostering a quality culture and mindset.

## Business Outcomes

This section lists the Business Outcomes expected of a candidate who has achieved the Agile Test Leadership at Scale Advanced Level certification.

An ATLaS Certified Test Leader can…

| ATLaS-BO1 | Foster a value-driven quality mindset and culture |
| --- | --- |
| ATLaS-BO2 | Understand fundamental concepts of software testing |
| ATLaS-BO3 | Demonstrate understanding of how different development and testing practices, and different constraints on testing may apply in optimizing testing to different contexts |

### BO 1 Foster a Value-Driven Quality Mindset and Culture

A person who has gained the qualification in this syllabus can in a value-driven organization build and sustain a quality and testing culture or in an organization which is not value-driven contribute to the transition to a value-driven culture.

An example of a measurable key result for the business outcome is:

* Provide quality assistance to x colleagues, who do not have a background in testing or quality management

(replace x with your own target).

### BO 2 Co-create and implement an organizational test strategy that develops quality and testing capabilities

In a value-driven organization, it is still crucial to have a strategy for building the required quality and testing capabilities to deliver customer and business value.

Examples of measurable key results for the business outcome are:

* A continuous reduction in lead time for Minimum Viable Products (MVP) or Minimum Marketable Features (MMF)
* Time for Minimum Viable Products (MVP) or Minimum Marketable Features (MMF)
* x % improvement in reaching business benefits
* x % reduction in production failures or customer complaints (a customer is whoever consumes your product or service)
* x% increase in quality improvement experiments inspired by the organizational test strategy
* x% increase in improvement feedback

### BO 3 Continuously improve test processes addressing challenges in the context of agile at scale product development

## Examinable Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level of Knowledge

Learning objectives support the business outcomes and are used to create the Advanced Level AgileTest Leadership at Scale exams.

In general, all content of this syllabus are examinable at a K1 level, except for the Introduction and Appendices. That is, the candidate may be asked to recognize, remember, or recall a keyword or concept mentioned in any of the chapters. The specific learning objectives levels are shown at the beginning of each chapter, and classified as follows:

* K1: Remember
* K2: Understand
* K3: Apply
* K4: Analyze

Further details and examples of learning objectives are given in Appendix A.

All terms listed as keywords just below chapter headings shall be remembered (K1), even if not explicitly mentioned in the learning objectives.

## Non-Examinable Hands-On Objectives

LOs and hands-on objectives (HOs) focus on practical skills and competencies. However, HOs are not examined by the multiple-choice exam questions. It is expected that HOs are covered either as part of an accredited training or as self-study. HOs are listed at the beginning of each chapter together with the LOs. The level of an HO is classified as follows:
*	H0: This can include a live demo of an exercise or recorded video. Since this is not performed by the trainee, it is not strictly an exercise.
*	H1: Guided exercise. The trainees follow a sequence of steps performed by the trainer.
*	H2: Exercise with hints. The trainee is given an exercise with relevant hints to enable the exercise to be solved within the given timeframe.
*	H3: Unguided exercises without hints.
 
Training material owners and people who self-study can find additional guidance on how to include practical elements to fulfil HOs in the ATLaS Accreditation Guidelines.

## The Agile Test Leadership at Scale Advanced Level Certificate Exam

The Agile Test Leadership at Scale Advanced Level Certificate exam will be based on both this syllabus and the body of knowledge. Answers to exam questions may require the use of material based on more than one section of this syllabus. All sections of the syllabus are examinable, except for the Introduction and Appendices. Standards and books are included as references, but their content is not examinable, beyond what is summarized in this syllabus and the ATLaS body of knowledge from such standards and books.

Refer to the Exam Structures and Rules document to understand the general exam rules.

Refer to the page for CTAL-ATLaS in the Exam Structure Table document for details about how an ATLaS exam is composed.

The entry criteria for taking the ATLaS exam are:

## Handling of Standards

There are standards referenced in the Foundation Syllabus (e.g., (IEEE, ISO, etc.)). The purpose of these references is to provide a framework (as in the references to ISO 25010 regarding quality characteristics) or to provide a source of additional information if desired by the reader. Please note that the syllabus is using the standard documents as reference. The standards documents are not intended for examination. Refer to section 5– References for more information on Standards.

## Keeping It Current

The software industry changes rapidly. To deal with these changes and to provide the stakeholders with access to relevant and current information, the ISTQB working groups have created links on the www.istqb.org website, which refer to supporting documents and changes to standards. This information is not examinable under the Foundation syllabus.

## Level of Detail

The level of detail in this syllabus allows internationally consistent courses and exams. In order to achieve this goal, the syllabus consists of:

* General instructional objectives describing the intention of the Advanced Level Agile Test Leadership at Scale Level
* A list of terms that students must be able to recall
* Learning objectives for each knowledge area, describing the cognitive learning outcome to be achieved
* A description of the key concepts, including references to sources such as accepted literature or standards

The syllabus content is not a description of the entire knowledge area of software testing; it reflects the level of detail to be covered in \< Level name\>Level training courses. It focuses on test concepts and techniques that can apply to all software projects, including those following Agile methods. This syllabus does not contain any specific learning objectives related to Agile testing, but it does discuss how these concepts apply in Agile projects and other types of projects.
