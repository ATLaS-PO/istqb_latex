ISTQB® Foundation Syllabus 2018 is a major update and rewrite of release 2011. For this reason, there are no detailed release notes per chapter and section. However, a summary of principal changes is provided here.

At the start of 2017 more than 550,000 people in more than 100 countries have taken the foundation exam, and more than 500,000 are certified testers worldwide. With the expectation that all of them have read the Foundation Syllabus to be able to pass the exam, this makes the Foundation Syllabus likely to be the most read software testing document ever!

This major update is made in respect of this heritage and to improve the next 500,000 people's view of the level of quality ISTQB® deliver to the global testing community.

In this version all learning objectives have been edited to make them atomic, and to create one-to-one traceability from learning objectives to content, and not having content without also having a learning objective.
