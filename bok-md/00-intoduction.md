## Examinable Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level of Knowledge

Learning objectives support the business outcomes and are used to create the Certified Tester \<Module Name\> Level exams.

In general, all contents of this syllabus are examinable at a K1 level, except for the Introduction and Appendices. That is, the candidate may be asked to recognize, remember, or recall a keyword or concept mentioned in any of the \<six\> chapters. The specific learning objectives levels are shown at the beginning of each chapter, and classified as follows:

* K1: Remember
* K2: Understand
* K3: Apply
* K4: Analyze
* K5: Evaluate
* K6: Create

Further details and examples of learning objectives are given in Appendix A.

All terms listed as keywords just below chapter headings shall be remembered (K1), even if not explicitly mentioned in the learning objectives.

## The \<Name of Syllabus\> Level Certificate Exam

The \<Name of Syllabus\> Level Certificate exam will be based on this syllabus. Answers to exam questions may require the use of material based on more than one section of this syllabus. All sections of the syllabus are examinable, except for the Introduction and Appendices. Standards and books are included as references, but their content is not examinable, beyond what is summarized in the syllabus itself from such standards and books.

Refer to Exam Structures and Rules document for the \<Name of Syllabus\> \<e.g. Exam Structures and Rules V1.1 Compatible with Syllabus Foundation and Advanced Levels and Specialists Modules\> document for further details.

The entry criterion for taking the \<Name of Syllabus \> exam \<e.g.ISTQB Certified Tester Foundation Level Software Testing\> is that candidates have an interest in software testing. However, it is strongly recommended that candidates also:

* Have at least a minimal background in either software development or software testing, such as six months experience as a system or user acceptance tester or as a software developer

* Take a course that has been accredited to ISTQB standards (by one of the ISTQB-recognized member boards).

Entry Requirement Note: The ISTQB® Foundation Level certificate shall be obtained before taking the \< Name of syllabus\> certification exam.

## Accreditation

An ISTQB® Member Board may accredit training providers whose course material follows this syllabus. Training providers should obtain accreditation guidelines from the Member Board or body that performs the accreditation. An accredited course is recognized as conforming to this syllabus, and is allowed to have an ISTQB® exam as part of the course.

The accreditation guidelines for this syllabus follow the general Accreditation Guidelines published by the Processes Management and Compliance Working Group.

## Handling of Standards

There are standards referenced in the Foundation Syllabus (e.g., (IEEE, ISO, etc.)). The purpose of these references is to provide a framework (as in the references to ISO 25010 regarding quality characteristics) or to provide a source of additional information if desired by the reader. Please note that the syllabus is using the standard documents as reference. The standards documents are not intended for examination. Refer to section 5– References for more information on Standards.

## Keeping It Current

The software industry changes rapidly. To deal with these changes and to provide the stakeholders with access to relevant and current information, the ISTQB working groups have created links on the www.istqb.org website, which refer to supporting documents and changes to standards. This information is not examinable under the Foundation syllabus.

## Level of Detail

The level of detail in this syllabus allows internationally consistent courses and exams. In order to achieve this goal, the syllabus consists of:

* General instructional objectives describing the intention of the \<Level name\> Level
* A list of terms that students must be able to recall
* Learning objectives for each knowledge area, describing the cognitive learning outcome to be achieved
* A description of the key concepts, including references to sources such as accepted literature or standards

The syllabus content is not a description of the entire knowledge area of software testing; it reflects the level of detail to be covered in \< Level name\>Level training courses. It focuses on test concepts and techniques that can apply to all software projects, including those following Agile methods. This syllabus does not contain any specific learning objectives related to Agile testing, but it does discuss how these concepts apply in Agile projects and other types of projects.
