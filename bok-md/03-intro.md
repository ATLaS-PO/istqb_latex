#	Continuous Improvement of Quality and Testing â€“ 150 minutes {#continuous-improvement-of-quality-and-testing}

As described in [Value Stream Mapping](#section:value-stream-mapping), value stream mapping and analysis help to identify quality and testing problems in a step of a value stream, which may be caused by things happening in a previous step or generate additional problems in a later step. One example is unclear user needs. If not discovered in early steps, unclear user needs may result in a complete solution being built that does not solve the user's problem. On the surface this may appear like a simple problem. However, understanding where things go wrong in the series of working steps and, equally important, understanding the underlying reasons why things go wrong may be much more complex. Once a deeper understanding is gained, improvement experiments can be introduced to solve the problem and prevent it from happening again. The PDCA Cycle is a method for organizing improvement, with experiments created by W. Edwards Deming.

Agile test leaders can promote and contribute to organizational learning by introducing a structured problem-solving approach. Furthermore, problem solving spanning multiple teams, and perhaps even multiple value streams, requires a broader and holistic view. Causal loop diagram (CLD) is a technique that is useful in this context when performing root cause analysis and retrospectives in general.
