# Appendix C – Release Notes {#release-notes}

ISTQB® Foundation Syllabus 2018 is a major update and rewrite of release 2011. For this reason, there are no detailed release notes per chapter and section. However, a summary of principal changes is provided here. Additionally, in a separate Release Notes document, ISTQB® provides traceability between the learning objectives in the 2011 version of the Foundation Level Syllabus and the learning objectives in the 2018 version of the Foundation Level Syllabus, showing which have been added, updated, or removed.

At the start of 2017 more than 550,000 people in more than 100 countries have taken the foundation exam, and more than 500,000 are certified testers worldwide. With the expectation that all of them have read the Foundation Syllabus to be able to pass the exam, this makes the Foundation Syllabus likely to be the most read software testing document ever!

This major update is made in respect of this heritage and to improve the next 500,000 people's view of the level of quality ISTQB® deliver to the global testing community.

In this version all learning objectives have been edited to make them atomic, and to create one-to-one traceability from learning objectives to content, and not having content without also having a learning objective.

The goal is to make this version easier to read, understand, learn, and translate, focusing on increasing practical usefulness and the balance between knowledge and skills.

* Fewer K1 learning objectives in general,
  * 15 LO in 2018 compared with 27 LO in 2011.

  * 15 LO in 2018 compared with 24 LO in 2011.
